# azure-email

The microsoft azure documentation, at the time of writing this library,
read something like "To authenticate with Azure, first open Visual Studio...".
Obviously this is not an option for Unix/non-DotNet developers. This code
implements an API that lets you send simple HTML/non-HTML emails with Azure.
